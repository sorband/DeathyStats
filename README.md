This addon will remind you how many times you died. It also takes a screenshot every time you level up.

 

Every time you die you will get a message telling you how many times you died that level and in that zone on that character. 

 

Usage: /ds or /deathy to find out how many times you died in your current area and at your current level.

 

 

Notes:

Due to current limitations, it will only tell you how many times you died since installing the addon.

Screenshots are saved in your WoW Screenshots folder.

  

ToDo:

1) A way to visualize the stats in-game

2) More annoying messages that make fun of you when you die
